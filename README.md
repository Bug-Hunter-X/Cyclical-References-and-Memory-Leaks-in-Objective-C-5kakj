This repository demonstrates a common, subtle bug in Objective-C related to memory management and cyclical references.  The `bug.m` file contains code that creates a cyclical reference between two objects, leading to a memory leak.  The `bugSolution.m` file shows how to resolve the issue using weak references.  Understanding object ownership and using weak references appropriately is crucial for preventing these types of memory leaks in Objective-C applications.
